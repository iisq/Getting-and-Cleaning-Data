## The data
1. The raw data is obtained from UCI Machine Learning repository.

## Variables
mean(): Mean value

std(): Standard deviation

mad(): Median absolute deviation 

max(): Largest value in array

min(): Smallest value in array

sma(): Signal magnitude area

energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 

iqr(): Interquartile range 

entropy(): Signal entropy

arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4

correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals

maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude

meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency

skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 

kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 

bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.

angle(): Angle between to vectors.

## Transformations
Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.

Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.

Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set

Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names.

From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
